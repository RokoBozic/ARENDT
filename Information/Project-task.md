Project Approach to Application Development
Study programme: Applied computing/Software Engineering
Study year: Second
Semester: Summer
General Instructions
The main goal of this course is to familiarize students with the process of creating an application
solution through the phases of gathering requirements, creating a prototype, planning tasks, testing,
development and deployment. Students must work in teams to develop a solution to a given
problem assignment.
Since this is a project-based course, there are no defined midterm exam and the course is taken
project-based, with an oral defense at the exam terms. At the oral defense, it is necessary to describe
and demonstrate the workflow of the applications and demonstrate a basic and advanced
understanding of the material defined in the outcomes. All team members must be present during
the oral defense.
It is important to emphasize that each member of the team must apply for the the exam individualy
in order to enable the acquisition of points and entering the final grade. Subsequent appeals and
applications are not accepted, as this instruction is clearly communicated at the beginning of the
course and before the start of the exam terms. During the exam terms, it is important to follow the
official announcements on Infoeduca regarding the schedule of oral defenses.
Students who defend their work on the exam terms in July can receive a maximum grade of excellent
(5). Students who defend the project on the exam terms in September can get a maximum grade of
very good (4) Students who defend their work on the exam terms in February can get a maximum
grade of good (3).
Before you can attend the project defense, you need to implement 50% of the required functional
requirements.
Project Task
In order for the team to approach the defense, it is necessary to send a compressed folder containing
the necessary documents listed through the learning outcomes. To submit the project, team must
send the comprossed zip archive containing the following files:
- Team[number]_FunctionalSpecification.pdf
- Team[number]_Wireframes.pdf
- Team[number]_AzureDevopsWorkItems.csv
- Team[number]_GitLog.txt
- Team[number]_UserInstructions.pdf
- Team[number]_Project
Where Team[number]_Project is directory containing project’s source files. If the archive does not
contain all of the listed files, the submission is not considered valid.
LEARNING OUTCOME 1 (Documentation, 17 points)
In this document, it is neceesary to list all functional and non-functional requirements (MINIMUM, 10
points), as well as analysis of assumptions, terms and restrictions (DESIRED, 7 points).
Document: Team[number]_FunctionalSpecification.pdf
LEARNING OUTCOME 2 (Wireframes, 17 points)
This document contains basic wireframes that need to be implemented (MINIMUM, 12 points) as
well as description of application workflow (DESIRED, 5 points).
Document: Team[number]_Wireframes.pdf
LEARNING OUTCOME 3 (Planning, 17 points)
This document contains CSV export of Azure Devops work items containing project’s task epics and
functionalities (MINIMUM, 12 points) as well as accurately described user stories and tasks
(DESIRED, 5 points).

LEARNING OUTCOME 4 (Code versioning, 17 points)
On github.com, it is necessary to create a public remote repository where it is possible to see the
activity of each team member during the development of the application. The activities include
opening a repository, commits, branches (MINIMUM, 10 points), pull requests and merge conflicts
resolution (DESIRED, 7 points). Document should include result of the following command:
“git log --decorate --graph --all”.
Document: Team[number]_GitLog.txt
LEARNING OUTCOME 5 (Testing, 16 points)
The following document contains CSV export of work items describing test cases for each user story
(MINIMUM, 9 points). Source code contains unit tests for all important features (DESIRED, 7 points).
Document : Team[number]_AzureDevopsWorkItems.csv
LEARNING OUTCOME 6 (User instructions, 16 points)
This document contains written user instructions for the developed application (MINIMUM, 12
points) as well as instructions for application deployment and release (DESIRED, 4 points).
